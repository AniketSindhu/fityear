## Inspiration
The new year is all about resolutions and one of the most common resolution is to become fit next year. So we developed an application that will help you achieve this in an interactive way. 

## What it does
This app counts your steps. There are different levels based on your steps(bronze up to 10k steps, silver up to 20k steps, gold up to 50k steps, platinum steps greater than 50k). The UI of the app changes on the basis of your level which enables an interactive user experience. There is a leaderboard section that shows all the users sorted on the basis of the steps they took this year which is also a source of motivation to complete this challenge. Also, we have various coupon codes for the users who are at the top. There is a timer on the homepage which shows the days remaining this year.  

## How I built it
We built the app with flutter and backend with firebase. We used cloud functions to reset the steps of every user at the end of the year.

## Challenges I ran into
Counting steps using the pedometer was quite a challenge.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
That we were able to complete it in such a less time with good UI.
